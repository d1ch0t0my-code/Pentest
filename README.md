This book is only intended to be a compendium of notes on pentesting and cybersecurity for personal use.

Initially the intention is that it will contain two main sections, one dedicated to pentesting notes and tools and another one of writeups where I will be adding the resolution of machines that I will be doing.

Although I have already said that these are just personal notes, if anyone wants to contribute with any suggestion, change or correction feel free to contact me via <mark style="color:blue;">Discord</mark>: **d1ch0t0my#7630**
